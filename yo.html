                Hey. I am Aditi Mishra. I love learning about new things, making new things and listening to music.<br><br>
                
                I am currently doing B.Tech in instrumentation and Control Engineering in NSIT, Delhi.
                Well, trying to do projects on any idea that pops up in my head because if you got no social life,you have way too much free time.
                I love binge-watching t.v. series..Who doesn't? I am an adventure- loving person . <br><br>
                Although, majority of my adventures occur in my dreams on my favourite place. my bed.
                
                If you would like to connect with me and talk to me regarding any improvements about website
                    or share any new ideas, connect me <a href="">here.</a> I would be all the more glad to hear from you and respond to it.
